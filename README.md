# GoHAL

`GoHAL` is an interpreter for the Esoteric Programming Language [`2001: An Esolang Odyssey`](https://esolangs.org/wiki/2001:_An_Esolang_Odyssey).

This is a toy project and was built for fun. If you run this and find bugs, please drop an issue, although be aware I might not be able to fix them.
